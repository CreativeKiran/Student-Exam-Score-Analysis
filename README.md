# Analysis of Student Performance Data

## Introduction
This project analyzes the performance of students based on various demographic and socio-economic factors. The primary objective is to understand how different factors such as gender, parental education, and parents' marital status affect student scores.

## Data Description
The data used in this analysis includes the following key features:
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Parental Education Level
- Parental Marital Status
- Student Scores in various subjects

## Analysis Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and incorrect data entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating charts and graphs to visualize the data.
3. Statistical Analysis: Using statistical methods to infer relationships between different variables.

## Results
### Gender Analysis
From the analysis, we observed that:
- The number of females in the data is more than the number of males.

### Parental Education Impact
From the analysis, we concluded that:
- The education level of parents has a significant positive impact on their children's scores. Higher parental education levels are correlated with higher student scores.

### Parental Marital Status Impact
From the analysis, we concluded that:
- There is no or negligible impact on the student's score due to their parents' marital status.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the analysis:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
